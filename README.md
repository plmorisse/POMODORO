# POMODORO project
The POMODORO project has the main purpose the creation of a timer following the POMODORO method( 25 minutes working 
and 5 minutes waiting time)

Thanks to specifications, users can, thanks to a button, start the timer and reset the app. The app switch automatically
between work and waiting period and the users can see the difference between the two periods. And users can choose time
for two parts of the timer.

But the app need to respect HTML, CSS validators of W3C, be responsive and meet accessibility requirements from the
standard WCAG AA 2.0.

The following project respect the specification give.

Optional functionality: Imagine and implement a method to keep the parameters entered by
the user in the browser

The optional functionality isn-t implement because of lack of time. But like it's an optional functionnality I favored 
the necessary functionality.

For start you have default value in input, this value are the true value for POMODORO timer. But you can change them by 
input you're time thanks to the keyboard or directly on the website thanks to the incrementaly arrows.
Then you have to click ont the start button for let begin the timer display on the middle of the app.
If you want to stop the timer you can reset the timer for put other time for every periods.

You can access to my app thanks to this link:
